#### The time taken by all files with bzip2 native hadoop compression without combiner is represented by the following graph and table.

S.No | Dataset         | Time Taken (seconds)
---  | ---             | ---
1    | 1990            | 1089
2    | 1990-92         | 1344
3    | 1990-91-92-93   | 2071

S.No | Dataset         | Time Taken (seconds)
---  | ---             | ---
1    | 1990            | 777
2    | 1990-92         | 970
3    | 1990-91-92-93   | 1264


### Explanation: The explanation has 2 parts like previous examples.

#### 1) Page 34 of the book talks about Combiner functions. So combiner acts like a local reducer. Time taken when file runs against MaxTemperatureWithCombiner code is less than that of MaxTemperature code.

#### 2) Native Hadoop Compression is discussed on Page 101 in the book. The compression codecs % change is shown in the following graph.

The Native hadoop compression took less time to run as compared to the java compression so it is faster as represented by the graph.
