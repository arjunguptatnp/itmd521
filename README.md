Part 2. 
My code is not running.
I broke down the components into various sub parts. I used the internet to see the code.
These are as follows:
1.	I first made a connection to the database. I used the internet to see the code. 
Reference: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jdbc/jdbc-sample-code.htm

2.	After that used the concept of FileInput Stream and GZIP input stream to read the file.
Reference: http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/File-Input-Output/Readsomedatafromagzipfile.htm

3.	Then I used substring concept using the explanation of the data from the book and found the indices of the substring as taught in the class. I used the below explanation to decide the indices.
