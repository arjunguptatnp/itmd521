Analysis of whole project is here in item-six which is as follows:

1) As far as gathering, processing and writing the code is considered, writing code for MapReduce was a pretty simple task. I have been seeing a similar code in previous assignments wherein we had find MaxTemperature from the NCDC weather set. Writing the SQL queries was also simple as once the schema was prepared, selecting the desired columns to fetch the data from, was a simple task. Similar case was with Hive.

2) I prefer using MapReduce and SQL over Pig, Hive and Sqoop as I have experience studying SQL since 6 years in school and bachelors. I have worked in the previous assignments on MapReduce and I understand the concepts of Mapper and Reduce(along with Combiner) to some extent so I am more comfortable with MR as compared to Pig, Hive and Sqoop. And just to add, I dont have any past work experience in Big Data.
